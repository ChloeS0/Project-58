        My favorite hobby is playing volleyball. I like volleyball because it is a very fun and competitive sport. It helps my communication as a team because to win and play well in a game, you need to have strong teamwork. I'm very enthusiastic when I'm playing volleyball. It also helps keep me healthy and keeps me motivated.
